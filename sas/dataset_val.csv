Polymer Investigation It will be not that different from the other test that was done because if there went down or up a little. He could have done a bar graph for the things he was trying to figure out about it all or just had at least told the time he did it.,0
"Polymer Investigation Based on the student's data you can tell that on plastic type A and is continue to expand after they are streched a second time, while plastic type C and D do not. The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how more weights they added to the plastic and adding a 3rd trial. Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment.",2
Protein Synthesis Item 1. The mRNA takes the copied information out into the cytoplasm.2. There tRNA brings in nucleotides to pair up with the mRNA inorder to make a copy of the DNA strand.3. An amino acid is then paired up with each set of three nucleotides.4. Once the process is completed it is used to make a protein.,0

Protein Synthesis Item the are read 3 at a timethey then turn into amino acids they make amino acid chainthen fix the problem,1
Protein Synthesis Item Major steps in protien synthesis is the mRNA leaves the nucleus. It separates strands and divides out of the nuleus's walls. Then the new copy is sent inside the nucleus. I new protien is made. There are many parts to this process but these are the main ones,0
Doghouse Item light gray :: The light gray color might affect the inside of the doghouse because if it isnt to dark or to light the inside wont be to hot or to cold. This is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy. The light gray was about in the middle with 45(DEG)c so i thought it was the best choice for the dog.,2
"Koala/Panda Item Both pandas and koalas are specialist species, they need a specific enviornment to live in. Pythons on the other hand can live almost anywhere.

Mr. Leonard Item The effect that the background information has on Paul was that he became motivated for something he had never done before. He had felt like he had something in common with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard went through the same troubles as Paul is now. Mr. Leonard said that he could not read either.,2
"Koala/Panda Item A panda and koala are specialists because they both only eat one thing. "" which eats almost nothing but bamboo ...eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"" the can't survive off anything else, but a python can eat a large variety of foods, and survive in many different locations, it is a generalist.",1

Rose is being thoughful when she doesn't tell her aunt the dream becasue it would hurt her feelings.",2
"Organization of Article Item In this article, the author has organized it in a unique way. The author has used the providing information to contrast the harmful dangers of space junk. The article is seperated in different categories where that topic is explained. The author tries to emphasize the importance of the outcome we will have if people ignore this situation. With no one to control the dead satellites, they run with great risks of 'colliding with each other.' This can cause a harmful effect and is what happened in February 2009. This impact caused hundreds of pieces of debris, each assuming its own orbital path.",2

"Cell Membrane Item diffusion, osmosis, active transport",0
Protein Synthesis Item Transaction.translation.transcription,0
Mr. Leonard Item The effects on paul was that he didnt know that Mr. Leonard was like that in collage.,0
"Doghouse Item white :: I would choose white because, white does not absorb a lot of light so there for, when iit is hot outside your dog will not get to hot inside of its doghouse. I choose the color white because in the experiment it shows that the average temperature for the white lid was 42 and for the Black lid it was 53. that is an 11(DEG)c difference between the two colors. So for a dog house I highly considered it being w hite.",2
"Cell Membrane Item Three processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the nucleus, flagellum and ribosomes.",0
"Mr. Leonard Item Paul feels like since Mr. Lenard has helped him become a track and field runner, he should help Mr. Lenard learn how to read. Paul does this by saying that Mr. Lenard has some training to do. Paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on Mr. Lenard. He was also empathetic for Mr. Lenard. He wanted to help Mr. Lenard like Mr. Lenard helped him.",2
"Invasive Species Item The significance of the term, ""Invasive species"" in this article is that some people. Find that unfair macInnes praters to say that they're ""introduced"". The significance is that some people do not want there nonnative species there, while others welcome them.",1
"Polymer Investigation (A)It appears that sample A was the strongest. After trial 1 it was 10mm and after trial 2 it was 12mm. Samples B and D were the weakest, sample B after trial 1 was 22mm and sample D was 20mm and after trial 2 sample B was 23mm and sample was 20mm.^p (B)One way the student could have improved the experiment is by specifically saying what plastic he was testing .

Finally the last paragraph is organized to explain how bad free-floating space junk can be.",1
Koala/Panda Item Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the each really live out of eating one thing. Pandas live off of eating nothing but bamboo. Koala's eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Pandas and koalas are different climates the live in. Pandas are from China and koalas are from Australia.,1
"Trait of Rose Item One trait that Rose has, is that she is overwhelmed and kind of frightened. She thinks that she wants to tell Aunt Kolab about her dream because she thinks that it will relieve stress on her.",0
Koala/Panda Item They are similar because they each eat plants from the enviroment like the panda eats nothing but bamboo and the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves exclusivly. They are both different from pythons because they don't eat other species.,0
Cell Membrane Item Osmosis is where water comes in and this process has to keep cells for becoming too engorged. Diffusion- where molecules move through the cell membrane. Facilitated diffusion- that is where molecules cannot get through and need help to do so.,0
Protein Synthesis Item The mRNA comes out of the cell and to protein. Then changes the RNA strand to an mRNA strand and makes proteins from there.,0

In this case by the snakes being invasive of other animals we are being invasive of other animals, we are now starting to see animal extinctions happen.",1
"Organization of Article Item The author does an excellent job at ordering the information of this article. They begin with an attention-getter in the opening paragraph to grab the reader's attention, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky!', then move into describing the topic of their article, space junk, more clearly, 'The disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk...'

Trait of Rose Item rose seems like she is not verry caring to anyone and i think this because of how she was rude to anna in their conversation,0
"Polymer Investigation Based on the students data, plastic type B and C stretched the most while plastics A and C stretched the least in both trials. ^p One thing the students could have done was include the length before the weights were put on it. Another thing they could have done is tell the actual weight amount & keep it constant for all plastic types.",2
Polymer Investigation a) A conclusion from this data is that plastic sample B is the the most stretchable.^p b) Two ways that the student could have improved the validity of the results are making the plastic samples the same initial size and allowing the plastic samples to stretch for more than five minutes.,2
"Koala/Panda Item As the author said towards the end of the article both of these are specialist animals who need to remain in one area to eat the food they are accustomed to. This would not allow these species to be invasive. This is much different to the pythons because that species can adapt any change to the environment around them, unlike the specialists which do very little change.",1
Doghouse Item white :: The darker colors will absorb heat faster tha n lighter colors.,0
Doghouse Item black ::  Black because it effect lid color on the air temperature and because it absob more energy.,0
Doghouse Item white ::  i chose white because the dog could go in the dog house and not get to hot from the heat of the sun because white does not catch heat as easaly as black.,1
Protein Synthesis Item the strand of DNA unzips and the mRNA fills in one of the sides of the DNA once the whole strand has been remade the mRNA goes to other cells in the body contain that needed information.,0
"Koala/Panda Item Pandas in china are similar to Australia's kolala  bear because they do not like change. They are specialists. These animals are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and can adapt very easily. "" What favors generalists is change, what favors specialists is stability, right now man kind is rapidly changing place.""",1
"Doghouse Item light gray :: If darker colors absorb more heat, then I'm g uessing that that means it absorbs cold temperatures too. So to keep it a t an even balance, I would say the color light gray is the best choice.",0
Cell Membrane Item The cells can be carried through th blood stream.,0
"Polymer Investigation Based on the students data, the plastic type A of trial 1 was stretched less than the plastic type B of trial 1, from A 10mm and B 22mm.

Organization of Article Item They did a great job oganising this article: first they get your attintion with grab you telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! Its a meteor!. Then they get right in to the article about the What is Space junk.,1
Protein Synthesis Item mRNA travels to give amino acids to tRNA which then transfers the information to a ribosome where it is then turned into a protien and last the protien is joined with others to make a strand of DNA.,0
Polymer Investigation A) A conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most flexibility. B) One way to improve the experiment would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same places. Another step would be to make sure the clamp was on the same place on each plastic so the experiment is more valid.,2
"Organization of Article Item The author has organized this article by asking questions or stating a subtitle for the next paragraph to answer. One subtitle is named 'Crash Course', the paragraph then explains how the crash coarse in made and how it is dangerous.",2
Koala/Panda Item Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist species. This is because they cannot survive outside their original habitat. Unlike pythons who are generalists species they can survive in generally any area.,1
"Organization of Article Item The author organizes by descibing space junk. the how space junk can collide with other space junk, thus explaining how the collisions leave debris and cause a problem.",2
"Koala/Panda Item Both China's panda and Australia's koala bear eat leaves, that is a similar but both of them are different from a python who need warm climate to stay alive, but a panda or koala bear have far a keep warm. Also pythons are cold blooded keep warm from the sun and hot area's.",1
"Trait of Rose Item Rose is a very hard working person she has many tasks to do in one day including, school, help around the hose, supper, work at the restaurant, homework, and her essay.",1
Doghouse Item white ::  It should be white so that on sunny days the dog will have a slightly colder dog house than if it was a darker color.,1
Acid Rain The first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers. How much distilled water has to be used to wash them and does the containers need to do the present exciddion,2

Protein Synthesis Item The protien brakes down,0
"Polymer Investigation a)The strechiest polymer plastic tested was type B, followed by type C then type A being the least stretchiest^p b)The student could have. Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid. Also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weights.",3
"Koala/Panda Item Pandas and koalas are specialist species. They both eat one particular thing. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves without these food source these two animals will not be able to survive. koalas and pandas are different from pythons because pythons are generalist species. They eat anything from large animals to small, birds other reptiles, etc. They can survive anywhere.",0
Acid Rain Additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar. You would also need to  know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use.,2
Organization of Article Item He's telling you to go outside and look at every thing floting around into space.,0
"Polymer Investigation A.In the polymer investigation there werent a lot of change plastic type a stretched only 2 mm, type B stretched 1 mm, type c stretched 1mm and D stayed the same.^p B.Could of been more accurate with the steps on the procedure.",0
Mr. Leonard Item It tells him a little about Mr. Leanard.  He finds out that Mr. Leanard was a great athlete but had a lot of trouble in school.,0
"Polymer Investigation Based on the students data results, plastic type D stretched the most. Plastic type A stretched the least. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are that they should of measured how long each piece of plastic was before they added the weights so they can know how much the plastic stretched. Also they should of used the same amount of weights.",3
Koala/Panda Item Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both need a special place to live that has no right food that they eat & the right climate they live in. Pythons are way different as in the article ''A generalist is a python the ultimate generalist arguably a human being'' meaning pythons can survive anywhere.,2
Doghouse Item light gray :: I chose light gray because it would stay cool in summer and a little warmer in the winter.,1
"Koala/Panda Item Pandas in China are similar to Koala in Australia because they both mainly rely on one food source and don't go around eating anything and everything like the python. "" A specialists is China panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's Koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. ""( Achenbach 5). This shows the two have eat only one type of food rather than eating everything around them.",1

"Acid Rain The students should have included information about what the 'samples' were, what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use.",3
"Mr. Leonard Item Near the end of the story Paul visits the website Mr. Leonard tells him to go to, and Paul is amazed Mr. Leonard was a track star in college. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he flunked out of college and lost his colleg scholarship because he couldn't read, and Paul was empathetic and in return decides to teach Mr. Leonard how read since he helped Paul in excelling at hurdling.",2
Organization of Article Item The author organize the article in sections with headers. The headers tell us what the sections are about.,1
"Invasive Species Item Invasive is used in this article as a negative term for foreign animals who invade places they aren't native to. However, the question is raised on whether or not these animals really are causing harm to their new home, and whether or not they are invasive. This article is basically, a discussion of whether or not these foreign animals are causing harm, and whether or not they're ""invasive.""",2

He explains what space junk is, what it can cause, and how important it is even though it may be small. He concludes by explaining that the problem will continue and someone needs to fix it.",1
"Organization of Article Item The author organizes the article by dividing it into detailed sections that explain the different subtitles. The whole article is about space junk, but each individual title explains different information to create organization. All of the authors thought that has to do with the crashing of space debris is under the title 'Crash Course,' all the information about the size of the debris is in the section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' These divisions help to make the article easier for the reader to understand.",1
"Invasive Species Item The significans of the word invasive in the article implies that the animals are in a place where they don't belong. The article says, even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair, he said. ""They're introduced, I think that invasive is passing judgement."" People who are for the reptiles believe this susedosa judgement to the animals the trade.",1
"Polymer Investigation A) In conclusion polymer B, is the one that could stretch the most, and polymer A is the one who can't stretch as wide. ^P B) To make the validity of the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurment, for example in step 2, the could of said how much it should be hanging by. Also, the could of added another trial, it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes.",3
"Invasive Species Item The word "" Invasive"" is significant to this article because it is the way people classify reptiles. In the article, he states that the U. S. fish and wildlife service is blocking him from importing some reptiles. The word "" invasive"" is used to describe these types of reptiles passing unfair judgement to them.",1
"Polymer Investigation A)Based on the student's data, the plastic that has has the most stretchability is plastic type A. It started at 10 mm and then the weight added on it stretched to 12mm. Plastic type D has no stretchability, It remained at 20 mm for the second trial.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the results and validity of them is by stating how much weight was added to each type of plastic bag. Also if you record the length A was before adding weights, you can see how for each bag stretched from itself. Right now there is no constant in the experiment.",2
Polymer Investigation Plastic sample B stretched the farthest.^p The experiment could have been improved by adding exact amount of what to be added on the plastics. Also to measure how much of the plastics edge to be taped to the table so they are standing at the same point.,3
"Acid Rain For this experiment, I would want to know how much vinegar I should pour into the cup. Pouring different amonts could change the mass. The other information I would need is if I needed to rinse the material in a timely manner (10 sec, 20 sec etc). this could also effect the mass of the material. I would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size. That also could effect the difference of the mass's.",3
"Organization of Article Item The author organizes the article by giving information about space junk, then talking about dead satellites and there risk of colliding with each other.

Protein Synthesis Item it goes to all the other RNA.,0
"Koala/Panda Item Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both plant eaters and are becoming extinct. They both differ to the python because the python is spreading rapidly. As stated in the article, ''many invasive species under go a lag before proliferating.'' which means that they are spreading rapidly.",0
Invasive Species Item Invasive in this article stood out in this article stood out in this article because it stated that bec the snakes were invasive but low ever it stands for an opponion.,0
Mr. Leonard Item he was a hurdler back then and he coudnt read,0
"Koala/Panda Item Pandas and koalas live in one specific area, china or Australia limited by its habits. Each animal ""eats almost nothing but bamboo, or... eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" A python, however, adapts and changes, giving it many options for survival, such as Asia or its now USA home.",2
Koala/Panda Item Pandas in China are similar to koala bears in Australia beause they both eat plants and try to stay out of harms way. On the other hand pythons are different because they will eat anything from mice to alli gators and kill what is ever in its path.,1
"Protein Synthesis Item The mRNA leaves the nucleus, and is then synthesized into tRNA, which carries the code for making proteins. The tRNA is transcribed into rRNA which can then be used by the body to synthesize proteins.",0
Mr. Leonard Item the information gave paul enthusiasm to do good because his coach did good to.,1
"Organization of Article Item The author of the article organizes the writing in a logical way. They first describe what space junk is in 'What Is Space Junk?'. They do this by giving a short history on the space invasion and a short explanation on how a satellite can 'die' and hurtle uncontrolably through space. Then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section 'Crash Course'. They explain how satelittes can collide and create massive amounts of microdebris that continue to orbit the Earth at incredible speeds. They also show how some astronauts can make mistakes such as losing the grip on their tool bag and causing the bag to begin orbiting the earth. In the final section, 'Little Bits, Big Deal', the author shows how dangerous this debris can be if it is traveling at a high rate of speed. The author provides startling evidence that microdebris can puch holes in spacecraft to inform the reader on the dangers of space junk.",2
"Acid Rain The additional information, I would add would be what was the starting before the whole process before the eu hours occurd.",0
Cell Membrane Item the cell membrane sends the a message to another part of the cell membrane. then it sends the substances threw tubes.,0
"Doghouse Item dark gray :: If they choose dark gray as the color for the doghouse, the temperature of doghouse would be neither too hot or too co ld for the dog. I chose dark gray because black would be too hot for dogs because they have furs but white would be too cold because even though t he dogs have furs, if the temperature is cold, thye will get cold. So i t hink dark gray is the best color to choose.",1
Protein Synthesis Item 1. ANAPHASE2. METAPHASE3. INTERPHASE4. PROPHASE,0
Organization of Article Item By the time and date that these things happened on. For example he started out in 1957 and then moved to recent day.,0
Cell Membrane Item passive transportactive transport,0
"Polymer Investigation a) Plastic type A, stretches longer than all other types, in other words it has more stretchability. Types B+C have the same stretchability, and D has the least stretchability, had the least durability, kepping it's structure while the others did not. ^p b)1) Made all the types start out in the same length. 2) specified the amount of weight that was applied, 3) Recorded the length of the sample before stretching it.",2
"Acid Rain Without the table, a lot wouldn't be known by looking just at the procedure. First, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what four samples you would be taking the mass of. Second, you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers. Lastly, in order to replicate the experiment, the person would need to know how much distilled water should be used to rinse the materials. It would also help if it was specified in the procedure, with what should the person be finding the mass of the materials (balance?). In what unit (grams?).",2
"Cell Membrane Item The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mitosis, meiosis, and photosynthesis.",0
"Protein Synthesis Item The mRNA is the messanger RNA. There are three different types of RNA. MRNA, which is messanger RNA. TRNA which is transfer RNA. And rRNA which creates ribosomes.",0
"Trait of Rose Item Through Rose's conversation with Anna, one can tell that Rose cares about family first.",1
Doghouse Item white :: white had the lowest temperature so the dogho use wont get extremely hot.,2
"Trait of Rose Item One trait that Rose has based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is never giving up. One detail that supports this, is that Rose never wants gives up. She has a lot going on but she's determined to keep going for it and never stop.",1
Mr. Leonard Item Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is just like him. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to understand that branching out will help him in the long run. He does not need to be so shy. By working hard Paul can accomplish anything.,1
"Protein Synthesis Item The mRNA copies the DNA, then it seperates, and an amino acid goes through. The last step is that it comes back together.",0
Koala/Panda Item Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both dependent on a certain food source where as pythons can adapt to the type of food they eat.,1
"Invasive Species Item The significance of the word invasive is significant to the article because it describes the reptiles being introduced to Florida as pets. They come, or are imported from foreign environments where they eat one thing but invade another continuity & eat what these ones do but in the case of it doesn't have enough the python had to find a new food which was alligator.",1
Cell Membrane Item Flaggelum is used to move. Also in mRNA.,0
